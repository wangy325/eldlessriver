##  The name

A studio album released by Pink Floyed in November 2014 was named *The Endless River*. Known as the last album by the famous England rock band. Also the band I love the most personally. So, I use 'endlessriver' as my personal blog name, showing respect to their great contribution to the modern music era.

By the way, *High Hopes* is my beloved through all rocks I ever listened. ^=^

## The blog

The blog was built around late 2019, driven by a Golang static blog generator named Hugo. And [Zoo](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo) was the theme at the very begining. Almost 4 years later, I chose [Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme as substitute to make it simple. The thing I want to do was focus on content itself but not the conten style. Though it really took my time to customize some tiny features like front-mata, copyright, back-to-top etcetra.

And yet, the srollspy TOC was still in the air. :-)

## The content

Most contents were like Learning Notes, especially those contents about Java/Python. Contents were written after reading Books like TIJ, TIP, or offical docs about all programming languages, or referring to excellent blogs writtern by others.

All code snipptes showed in contents can be find in this [Repo](https://github.com/wangy325/java-review).

Due to this, this blog looks more like a doc page, which theme Book is desgined for docs.

Also, there are some 'practical guides' type contents, but not that much. I should write more blogs like that, I think. /*\

Besides, I was thought to translate some English posts. Now I perfer to quote them or write some.

## The author

Learning coding all by self, by passion, by love. But obstacles everywhere. Don't know how long can I persist in doing this.  Sounds sad, but it's truth. (-:
